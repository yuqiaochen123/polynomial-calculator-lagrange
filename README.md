# Polynomial Calculator with Lagrange Interpolation

A web-based calculator that computes polynomials passing through given points using Lagrange Interpolation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Point Input**: Add/remove coordinate pairs as needed
- **Lagrange Interpolation**: Mathematical algorithm to find the unique polynomial
- **Beautiful Display**: Clean, responsive design with mathematical notation
- **Polynomial Evaluation**: Test the computed polynomial at any x value
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design that works on all devices

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern styling and animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- MathJax (for mathematical notation)

## How to Use

1. Enter at least 2 coordinate pairs (x, y)
2. Click "Add Point" to include more points if needed
3. Click "Compute Polynomial" to calculate the interpolating polynomial
4. Use the evaluation section to test the polynomial at specific x values

## Live Demo

The calculator finds the unique polynomial of degree n that passes through your n+1 given points, making it perfect for students learning about polynomial interpolation.
